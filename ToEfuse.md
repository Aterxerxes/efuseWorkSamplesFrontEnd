### I'm going to put my thoughts in here as I have them to (hopefully) give you insight into my thought process.
1. I'm trying to learn next 13, so as to keep up on the latest and greatest.
1. I want to design much of the framework first, then go into composing things later.
1. I have really disliked the paradigm of Redux, so I'm going to try a new(er) technology called Recoil.
1. I'm going to be building from scratch (no create-react-app or create-next-app), so that I really let some of the understanding seep into my proverbial bones.
1. I won't be hosting this elsewhere. All of the steps to get it running should be in the Readme when at the end.
1. I began at approximately 9:30 AM (Mountain) on 11/21/2022, any gaps will be noted.
1. A "Running Commentary" can be found [here](RunningCommentary.md)
